# No More Carl-bot

### The Aim&#x20;

### Overview

Carl bot is a great bot, rather was a great bot. The bot has been one of the most popular in the last 2 years through out 2020 and 2021. However, the bot has lacked being updated, unable to offer some key features that discord has made available. The bot does not support buttons nor dropdowns, the bot written in discord.py which is no longer being maintained, the bot does not support threads at all, nor does it support slash commands.

Again the bot is still viable, but it shouldn't be your primary bot if you're managing large servers where the bot's functionality is critical. The bot also has a list of bugs which are yet to be fixed which have been there for almost 2 years. You can see the list of bugs and their progress states here: https://trello.com/b/CkHAU9i5/carlbot-development. A point to note is that not all the bugs reported are even on the trello board. However a handful bugs have been fixed but not what you'd expect from a bot like that.
