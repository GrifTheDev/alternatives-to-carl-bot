# No More Carl-bot

### The Aim&#x20;

### Overview

We hope you’ve found this resource helpful and that it has saved your time trying to find better bots than carl. Our suggestion is that you take 2 or 3 bots that cover the majority of what carl could do. A combination of Dyno, Atlas or Robot along with other bots should have you covered and replace carl completely.

Dyno also has its drawbacks but it is proven to be a better bot than carl, not only in terms of features, but also in terms of development, updates and uptime.
