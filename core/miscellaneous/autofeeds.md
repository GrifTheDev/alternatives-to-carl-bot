# Autofeeds

### [Sapphire](https://sapph.xyz)

Autofeeds whether they be plain text messages or embeds. You can set them to post at one time or have them repeat at a duration. Sadly the bot does not support any type of TagScript like Carl-but Sapphire has its own unique benefits. You send the autofeed via a webhook allowing for custom profile picture and username to fit your server's theme. You can attach components such as buttons and dropdowns to carry out certain actions. The bot also offers complete customisation of bot messages and has a granular automod too. A niche bot that any user who prefers complete control can appreciate.&#x20;
