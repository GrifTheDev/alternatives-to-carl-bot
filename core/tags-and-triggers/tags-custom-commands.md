# Tags / Custom Commands

### [Kronos](https://top.gg/bot/632872758665281567) and [Noumenon](https://top.gg/bot/634866217764651009)&#x20;

Both of these bots use TagScript for custom commands and are most apt to be used to replace carl bot. The TagScript engine used in both bots uses Phen's TS Engine. The TS docs for that can be found here: [https://phen-cogs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://phen-cogs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Although Carl's TS has more functionality, since it's been using TS for custom commands for so long now, these 2 other bots have some benefits such as: You can grant roles which may have some scary permissions, a built in cooldown block and granular overrides for override blocks.&#x20;
