### [Suggestions](https://suggestionsbot.com)

Carl-bot's suggestions are lacking in many ways. Thought it may be "good enough" for most servers, any power users would prefer using an alternative better bot for suggestions. Both the bots Suggestions and Suggester offer features that Carl-bot doesn't, such as allowing users to change voting emojis, managing staff roles and more. Suggestions bot also allows for a second  staff suggestions feature that is meant to be for server managers and staff to discuss their own suggestions internally.&#x20;

### [Suggester](https://suggester.js.org/#/)

Suggestor is the bot for power users who want complete customizability. The bot allows for mass suggestion decisions, mass deleting, silent deleting, blocking users, suggestion cooldown timers and much more. Suggester has many more features than suggestions bot that might not be necessary for most servers, but surely power users will appreciate the additional customizability&#x20;
