### [Suggestions](https://suggestionsbot.com)

Carl-bot's suggestions are lacking in many ways. Though it may be "good enough" for most servers, any power user would prefer using an alternative bot for suggestions. Both the bots Suggestions and Suggester offer features that Carl-bot doesn't, such as allowing users to change voting emojis, managing staff roles and more. The Suggestions bot also allows for a secondary staff suggestions channel, that allows staff members to discuss suggestions internally.&#x20;

### [Suggester](https://suggester.js.org/#/)

Suggester is the bot for power users who want complete customizability. The bot allows for mass suggestion decisions, mass deleting, silent deleting, blocking users, suggestion cooldown timers and much more. Suggester has many more features than the suggestions bot, that might not be necessary for most servers, but power users will surly enjoy the additional customizability.&#x20;
