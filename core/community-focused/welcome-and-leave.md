# Welcome & Leave

### [Atlas](https://atlas.bot)

Atlas offers the same types of messages from its welcome module. Either a plain text message or embed for a welcome, leave, dm on join and ban message except that you can specify a separate channel for each message event which carl lacked. Easy to set up from the atlas’ dashboard and fully customisable.

### [Welcomer](https://www.welcomer.gg)

Another alternative to Carl’s welcome messages which were more advanced involving images. Welcomer allows you to have customised welcome images per user which had to be done involving TagsScript and online cloud-based image manipulation websites and APIs which would get unreasonably complicated for the average discord user. Using Welcomer's user-friendly dashboard you can create welcome messages, embeds and images as well as the same for leave messages. The bot is also featured in the Roles section as it allows for autoroles and timed roles.
