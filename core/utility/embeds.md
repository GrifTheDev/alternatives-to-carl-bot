If you’d like a more custom embed whereas where the embed is sent with a custom profile picture and name, Discohook is the way to go. This isn’t a bot but rather a website that sends a custom embed via webhooks. Simply create a webhook for a particular channel, paste it into discohook’s dashboard, design the embed to your liking and hit send! Discohook also allows you to edit previous embeds sent via the webhook.
