### Streamcord - Twitch Notifications&#x20;

As many of us know Carl-bot promotes that it has a twitch feature, which it does but has not been fully functional for over a year now. There doesn't seem to a fix for it soon either. Streamcord allows users to have upto **25** twitch live stream notifications. Streamcord has an intuitive dashboard which for easy customisation. They also allow for Live Stream Roles when someone is streaming on twitch along with a few other features pertaining to twitch.
