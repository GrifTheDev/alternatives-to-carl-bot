# Automod

### [Dyno](https://dyno.gg)

Thereâ€™s many Auto-moderation bots out there. Dyno is one of the most popular and is often compared to Carl-bot. The Automod filters consist of banned words, all caps, anti-copypasta, anti-spam, anti-invite and anti-links. Along with this dyno also offers anti-image-spam, mass mention, emoji and sticker spam prevention as well. The automod is setup via the dashboard and is simple to also set up ignored roles and channels that you want to bypass automod.
