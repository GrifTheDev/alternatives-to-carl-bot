# Automod

### [Dyno](https://dyno.gg)

There are many Auto-moderation bots out there. Dyno is one of the most popular and is often compared to Carl-bot. The Automod filters consist of banned words, all caps, anti-copypasta, anti-spam, anti-invite and anti-links. Along with this, dyno offers anti-image-spam, mass mention & emoji and sticker spam prevention as well. The automod is setup via an intuitive dashboard, and it is easy to setup ignored roles and channels that you want the automod to bypass.
