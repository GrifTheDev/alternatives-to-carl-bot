# Moderation

### [Dyno](https://dyno.gg)

Dyno was designed to be a moderation bot and is one of the most popular choices for new and veteran discord users. It has an easy to set up and intuitive dashboard which users can appreciate. The bot has all the expected moderation commands from basic banning, kicking muting and warning to locking singular to multiple channels, having individual user notes and having advanced message purge/prune features. Dyno was also mentioned in the Automod category and more often than not it is good practice to have 1 bot that handles the majority of moderations and one other backup mod bot.

Quark is a new up and coming bot that utilises all of discord’s latest features. It is easy to use and simply works straight out of the box. The bot detects which roles have the inherent permissions to kick ban and will allow those roles to use those relative moderation commands based on the role perms. The bot also works with discord’s timeout feature (soon™) and is always up-to-date. The bot is also mentioned in the logging section as it simply has well a designed logging system. You can also instantly ban and grab user IDs of new members joining from the join and leave log as the bot attaches a ban button to each join message. The bot also features a simple purge.
