# Logging

### **Simple Logs -** [**Quark**](https://top.gg/bot/704802632660943089) ****&#x20;

Simple logs Quark offers logging of messages, join & leave logs, and voice logs. Additionally, the bot also offers attachment logs which carl doesn’t. The media which gets logged can also have spoilers enabled on them! The bot log embeds are designed well offering you to grab the user ID of the logged member whilst also allowing you to ban users in the join logs using buttons. You can additionally customise the colour of the embeds as well. Quark has its own moderation slash commands as well, along with a modlog. The bot will soon also work with discord’s timeout feature.

### Granular logs - [Dyno](https://dyno.gg) &#x20;

Dyno is mentioned here again simply because it offers granular logging. You can split each log event into separate channels. Logging events include but are not limited to channel events, role events: member events and voice events. You also have the option to filter out which roles and channels can be ignored by Dyno’s logs. Dyno also has an automod log moderation log.

### Avatar logs - [RoboTop](https://robotop.xyz)

Avatar logs To replace Carl’s avatar logging you can use RoboTop. The bot has many additional features too, but for this section, we are solely focusing on logs. RoboTop is able to log all discord events just like Dyno

**RoboTop's Logs all go in 1 channel. You can not split them**
