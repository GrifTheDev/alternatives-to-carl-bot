# Autoroles

### [Welcomer](https://welcomer.gg)

Welcomer bot like the name suggests has to do with welcoming users and provides a broad feature set around said topic. Welcomer is also featured in the [Welcome & Leave](../community-focused/welcome-and-leave.md) section. You can use welcomer the same way you use carl by assigning autoroles as soon as a person joins the server or having a delayed autorole which applies after a set duration. The autorole feature if using like carl bypasses discord's membership screening. However using the delayed autorole feature from Welcomer you can have the autorole apply after the user sends a message which can only be done post membership screening. If you want to have a role apply as soon as a user accepts the rules via membership screening see below.&#x20;

### [GateKeeper](https://top.gg/bot/818808873166176266)&#x20;

GateKeeper bot has but one function, to handout autoroles after one accepts rules from membership screening. You can add up to 5 autoroles with the free version. The bot also has a beta "auto-kick" feature for those who don't pass membership screening for a certain amount of time. The bot also has welcome messages which send post membership screening
